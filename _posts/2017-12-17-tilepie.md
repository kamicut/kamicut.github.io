On a [@drewbo](https://twitter.com/drewbo19) suggestion I built [tilepie](https://github.com/kamicut/tilepie) and published it on [Pypi](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/tilepie). This is a simplified, non-feature complete python port of [@mapbox/tilereduce](https://github.com/mapbox/tile-reduce) that allows us to read and process vector tiles in parallel. With this tool, you could for example read the OSM QA tiles and quickly get a count of buildings for a country.

Porting this to python opens vector tile processing to use Numpy and Scipy. We will be using `tilepie` at Development Seed to improve our machine learning training sets, but I'd love to hear it being used in other places! 

Simple example:
```python
from tilepie import tilereduce
import mapbox_vector_tile

total_count = 0

## Define a mapper function that operates on each tile
def mapper(x, y, z, data):
  if data is None:
          return 0

  tile = mapbox_vector_tile.decode(data)

  count = 0
  if (tile['osm']['features']):
    count = len(tile['osm']['features'])

  return count

## Define a callback when each tile finishes
def callback(count):
  global total_count
  total_count += count
  
## Define a function that runs at the end of all jobs
def done():
  global total_count
  print total_count
  
# Call tilereduce
# This is using lebanon.mbtiles from the QA Tiles
tilereduce({
    'zoom': 12,
    'source': '~/data/lebanon.mbtiles',
    'bbox': (35.1260526873, 33.0890400254, 36.6117501157, 34.6449140488)
  },
  mapper,
  callback,
  done
)

# Output is 86343
```
