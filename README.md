This is the code and data that builds my personal website.
I mostly write about the projects and experiments I'm working on, usually in [open data](http://github.com/openleb).

The cool canvas animation next to my name was created based off of code by [Mikola Lysenko](http://github.com/mikolalysenko). His work is awesome and you should check it out.
